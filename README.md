## Game Architecture

### Core Systems

1. **Game Engine** (`GameEngine.ts`)
   - Game loop management
   - State management
   - Entity updates
   - Game flow control

2. **Physics Engine** (`PhysicsEngine.ts`)
   - Object movement
   - Velocity calculations
   - Boundary constraints
   - Enemy AI behaviors

3. **Collision Detection** (`CollisionDetection.ts`)
   - AABB collision detection
   - Circular collision detection
   - Spatial optimization
   - Line-of-sight calculations

4. **Rendering System** (`GameRenderer.tsx`)
   - SVG-based graphics
   - Efficient rendering
   - Visual effects
   - UI overlays

### Multiplayer Architecture

- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time data exchange
- **Room Management**: Create, join, and manage game rooms
- **State Synchronization**: Keep all players in sync
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle network issues gracefully

## Controls

### Touch Controls
- **Move**: Drag your finger to move the spaceship
- **Shoot**: Tap anywhere on the screen to fire
- **Pause**: Tap the pause button in the top-right corner

### Game Elements

#### Power-ups
- 🟢 **Health**: Restores player health
- 🟠 **Weapon Upgrade**: Improves weapon capabilities
- 🔵 **Shield**: Temporary invincibility
- 🟡 **Speed Boost**: Increases movement speed
- 🟣 **Score Multiplier**: Doubles points for limited time

#### Enemies
- **Red (Basic)**: Standard enemies with predictable movement
- **Orange (Fast)**: Quick enemies with erratic movement
- **Purple (Heavy)**: Tough enemies with more health
- **Pink (Boss)**: Large enemies with special attack patterns

## Development

### Building for Production

1. **Android APK**
   ```bash
   npx expo build:android
   ```

2. **iOS IPA**
   ```bash
   npx expo build:ios
   ```

3. **EAS Build (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @expo/eas-cli
   eas build --platform android
   eas build --platform ios
   ```

### Play Store Preparation

1. **App Icons**: Already configured in `app.json`
2. **Splash Screen**: Configured for professional appearance
3. **Permissions**: Minimal permissions for better approval
4. **Performance**: Optimized for 60 FPS on mid-range devices
5. **Content Rating**: Suitable for all ages

### Multiplayer Server

For multiplayer functionality, you'll need to set up a WebSocket server:

```javascript
// Basic server setup (Node.js + Socket.io)
const io = require('socket.io')(3001);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('Player connected:', socket.id);
  
  socket.on('createRoom', (roomData) => {
    // Handle room creation
  });
  
  socket.on('joinRoom', (roomId) => {
    // Handle room joining
  });
  
  // Add more multiplayer event handlers
});
```

## Performance Optimization

- **60 FPS Target**: Optimized game loop and rendering
- **Memory Management**: Efficient object pooling
- **Battery Optimization**: Reduced CPU usage when possible
- **Network Efficiency**: Minimal data transmission
